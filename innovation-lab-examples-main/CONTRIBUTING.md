# Agent Contribution Guide

This repository is open for community contributions.  
Any user can submit a new agent example through a pull request.

This guide explains how to add agents in a consistent, review-friendly format.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a feature branch from `main`.
3. Keep changes focused (one feature/fix per PR).

```bash
git checkout -b feat/short-description
```

Star this repository before raising a PR (CLI):

```bash
gh repo star fetchai/innovation-lab-examples
```

## Who Can Add an Agent?

- Anyone can contribute an agent example (community members, students, builders, and teams).
- You do not need to be part of the core team to open a PR.
- The PR author must star this repository before opening a PR.
- All contributions are reviewed before merge.

## How to Add a New Agent Example

When adding a new agent, please follow this structure:

1. Create a dedicated folder for the agent.
2. Add source code and dependency files.
3. Add a complete `README.md`.
4. Add demo assets (image/GIF).
5. Add `.env.example` if env vars are required.

Recommended folder layout:

```text
<agent-folder>/
  README.md
  requirements.txt
  .env.example
  agent.py
  assets/
    demo.png
```

## Local Development Checks (CLI)

Many examples are Python-based. Run these checks before opening a PR.

Install `ruff` (if needed):

```bash
python -m pip install ruff
```

Lint:

```bash
ruff check .
```

Format:

```bash
ruff format .
```

Optional auto-fix:

```bash
ruff check . --fix
```

## `.env` and Secrets Policy

- Never commit real secrets, API keys, private keys, or tokens.
- If your example uses environment variables, include a `.env.example` file.
- Document each variable in README with a short description.
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` in project folders where needed.

Example:

```env
# .env.example
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AGENTVERSE_API_KEY=your_agentverse_key_here
```

## README Quality Requirements

Every new or updated example should have a clear README. At minimum include:

- What the project does (2-4 lines).
- Prerequisites and installation steps.
- `.env` variable setup section.
- How to run the project.
- Expected output or behavior.
- Troubleshooting notes (if relevant).
- Agent profile link (if deployed/published).

Use this ready-to-copy template:
- `docs/AGENT_README_TEMPLATE.md`

## Demo and Agent Profile Requirements

To make examples easy to verify, please add:

- A demo image or GIF (recommended: ASI demo screenshot) in the example README.
- A link to the deployed or published agent profile (for example, Agentverse profile URL), when available.

Recommended asset path:

```text
<example-folder>/assets/demo.png
```

Recommended README snippet:

```markdown
## Demo
![ASI Demo](./assets/demo.png)

## Agent Profile
[View Agent Profile](https://agentverse.ai/)
```

## Pull Request Checklist

- Keep PRs small and scoped to one improvement.
- Add or update README for the agent.
- Include setup or testing notes for reviewers.
- Add `.env.example` if environment variables are required.
- Include demo image/GIF and agent profile link when applicable.
- Run `ruff check .` and `ruff format .` before submitting.
- Add a changelog entry in `CHANGELOG.md` for non-doc changes.
- Ensure all CI checks pass on `pull_request`:
  - `stargazer-gate`
  - `changelog-check`
  - `lint`
  - `format`
  - `typecheck`
  - `validate-architecture`
  - `test`
- Reference related issues when applicable.

## How to Raise Issues

- Use `ISSUES_GUIDE.md` before creating an issue.
- Choose the matching issue template:
  - Bug report
  - Error report
  - Wrong path report
  - Code issue report
  - Feature request
- Add clear reproduction steps, affected path, and logs.

PRs also use a default template:
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`

## Security Reporting

- Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.
- Follow `SECURITY.md` to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
- Never include real secrets (keys/tokens/private credentials) in issues or PRs.

## Merge Policy

- Direct merges to `main` are not allowed.
- Every PR must have at least one review from the Fetch.ai team before merge.
- Community users can open PRs, but merge happens only after review approval.
- Branch protection should require:
  - Required pull request reviews: `1`
  - Required status checks:
    - `stargazer-gate`
    - `changelog-check`
    - `lint`
    - `format`
    - `typecheck`
    - `validate-architecture`
    - `test`
